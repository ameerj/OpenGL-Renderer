# OpenGL-Renderer

This is a project that acted as an Independent Study course in Advanced Real-time Rendering.

This was an exploration into more advanced usages of OpenGL. I worked with my graphics professor who acted as an advisor for guiding my independent explorations into some more advanced uses of OpenGL.

The following has been implemented in standalone scenes:

- 3D Wavefront Obj model rendering with texture mapping
- Bezier Patch tessellation using a Tessellation Shader
- "Exploding" models using a Geometry Shader
- Basic particle manipulation using Transform Feedback
- Real-time dynamic point shadow mapping
- Real-time reflections (Work in progress)
